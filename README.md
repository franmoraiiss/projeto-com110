## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª About the project

- <p style="color: red;">The game Padawan Adventures is a game in the shape of a maze, which the character must find the correct way to move to the next world, for that he must collect all the coins (‚çü) existing on each map, collecting all he gets his ticket to the next world. In each world, in addition to the coins, there are also enemies (‚ò†), which should be avoided, because once they are touched the character goes back to the beginning of the map and loses a life, and if the character loses all lives he loses the game. But during the game, as long as the number of lives is not zero, there are extra lives (‚ù§) that can be collected and added to the current number of lives (maximum 3 lives).
 
The characters evolve at each level, following the base of the chess characters, initially the character is a pawn (‚ôô), and follows an order until at the last level, when the objective is reached and the young Padawan advances on the last map he becomes a Jedi (‚ôî), and has a free pass to collect the trophy (‚ùÑ) and end the game.</p>
